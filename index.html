        <h2>True Hackers</h2>
        <p>Friday, August 30, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          “The world opened up by the computer was a limitless one”<br /><br />
          What is a true hacker? Steve Levy states that a true hacker is
          knowledgeable in their technology domain to push boundaries and
          explore systems, is driven by curiosity and a passion for
          problem-solving, and is committed to the principles of openness,
          mistrust authority(promote decentralization), and all information
          should be free. A true hacker is characterized by the obsessiveness of
          their craft, determination, curiosity, and openness.
          <br /><br />
          One quality that stands out to me is hackers believe that “essential
          lessons can be learned about the systems(about the world) from taking
          things apart, seeing how they work, and using that knowledge to create
          new and more interesting things”. The first thing that comes to mind
          is why? To satisfy their curiosity? To fix a broken thing or to
          improve the performance of a system? “Imperfect systems infuriate
          hackers, whose primal instinct is to debug them.” You can create art
          and beauty on a computer and hackers are the artists who paint with
          the brush. In a way, the hacker is an example of inheritance best of
          both worlds. A perfectionist who envisions the perfect system and an
          action taker who’s not afraid to act on their vision and dive into the
          unknown by tearing things apart, improving existing systems, or
          building a new creation from the ground up. I admire them for being
          the brave ones in their domain.
          <br /><br />
          True hackers share this belief that whatever goal they set their mind
          to, they will achieve it, one way or another. They have this “blind
          confidence” in their capability to create something out of limited
          resources. If a program does not exist, they will bring it to life.
          Peter Samson had a deep interest in music and computers, and he
          translated his interests into the creation of a pioneering program
          that allowed the cranky huge machine to play music, which was unheard
          of at the time.
          <br /><br />
          The standard thinking on computer, their time was so precious that one
          should only attempt things which took maximum advantage of the
          computer. However, hackers chose to act on their beliefs: anything
          that seemed interesting or fun was fodder and encouraged. Of course,
          such pursuit resulted in pioneering programs such as Music Player and
          Spacewar. Another quality that I admire about hacker culture is they
          believe that learning comes from doing, and not merely from the
          classroom. TMRC hacker Bob Wagner wrote 3000 lines of code for a
          computer program to perform the function of a calculator and proudly
          did his Numerical Analysis homework on it. He received an 0 for
          achieving the same goal with significantly more complicated methods
          but he couldn’t care less. Arguably, when he went out of his way to
          integrate his passion into problem-solving required significantly more
          learning while achieving the same goal.
          <br /><br />
          A notion that has initially struck me is how hackers believe that
          information should be free. Steve "Slug" Russell and his peers who
          created and improved the original Spacewar game decided to freely
          distribute the software of video games to others as they are open and
          welcoming for anybody to make changes and improve the games. They
          weren’t thinking of profit but the contribution to the open-source
          community. For some reason, I keep thinking about how Steve Jobs and
          Steve Wozniak made Blue boxes that allowed people to make free,
          illegal, long-distance phone calls and they decided to sell for
          profit. Even though they were not in the same time period, could it
          mean hackers share a common ethics but still act on their own beliefs?
          <br /><br />
          I found the idea of a true hacker inspirational. My previous
          impression of a hacker is someone who uses their knowledge of
          technology to illegally break into a digital system to take advantage
          of the breach, mostly for financial gain or access to information.
          Levy’s writing challenged my notion of a hacker and allowed a
          comprehensive view of their characteristics and ethics from the
          original hackers. I started to understand their motives and drives
          come from curiosity and implementing improvement to the system. In
          many ways, I believe I subscribe the the hacker’s beliefs, values, and
          way of thinking. The hacker culture is “hermit-like”, which is true to
          some extent. They avoid people that’s not their kind but have no
          problem socializing with fellow hackers. It functions like the star in
          the space war game that pulls like-minded people in with gravitational
          force, with their love for hacking, sci-fi references, bad movies, and
          Chinese food. As much as I share similar passions and interests, I do
          not see myself living the lifestyle of a true hacker as I believe that
          there’s more to life. I believe in taking what’s good and abandoning
          what’s bad. For example, I subscribe to obsessiveness over one’s craft
          and improvement in the system, but I also value balance and a somewhat
          healthy lifestyle which prevent me from staying up all night for a
          30-hour hacking session. However, something I’ve always believed in is
          that we could be the best of both worlds.

        <h2>Hardware Hackers</h2>
        <p>Sunday, September 08, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          People would pay for a hammer to do its job, not for it to exist.
          <br /><br />
          True hackers value technical ability and raw creativity that proves
          oneself that’s worthy to their inclusive community of hacking into
          software. Anyone who can’t or who doesn’t dedicate all of their time
          to hacking is considered a “loser". Hardware hackers were activated
          during the Vietnam War and the hippie and counter-culture movements.
          They believe that bringing computers to the masses would create a
          better and more liberated society and technology would empower people
          and the world. The computer was a tool that large institutions had
          sequestered. Opening it up and making it available to everyone was the
          ultimate act of liberation.
          <br /><br />
          Upon reading the second part of the book, I’m mostly intrigued by why
          the notion of free software couldn't continue outside the MIT lab.
          Certainly, we have to bring up two of the biggest tech companies in
          the world that were born during the hardware hackers era. With the
          popularity and the floating copies of Altair Basic, Bill Gates
          published "An Open Letter to Hobbyists" and called out that software
          would only be better when people received incentives for their hard
          work. At Apple, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs had different opinions on
          the approach to personal computers, especially regarding whether they
          should be free and accessible to everyone or commercialized. Something
          worth noticing is that at MIT labs software was freely distributed
          among students, even placed in a drawer right next to the computer.
          The Homebrew Computer Club follows the rule that if you take one copy
          of the software, you should bring back two copies. Times have changed
          when computers reached the hands of hardware hackers, this is the era
          when the ideal was compromised into reality when business and
          profitability were taken into personal computers. As much as I
          subscribe to the true hackers’ ethics, I must admit that hackers
          themselves exist in a niche market. The idealization of 100% freely
          distributed software will work in a niche environment like MIT hackers
          when the student group devotes their entire life to hacking when the
          club of true hackers itself is exclusive. Once the technology is
          brought to the masses by hardware hackers, there will inevitably be
          friction during adoption. Human nature is complex and dynamic. I think
          Bill Gates is only the first person to decide to profit from the
          software. If it wasn’t him, it would be someone else. Just like how
          Amazon survived to be the biggest commerce website in the US, if not
          for Jeff Bezos, someone would have decided and succeeded in profiting
          from the online shipping theme of the internet age. Proprietary
          software has shaped today's industry standards, with companies like
          Microsoft and Apple embodying the entrepreneurial spirit of early
          hardware innovators
          <br /><br />
          Why can't we have free software? I would say the reason behind it is
          rooted in human nature around value and ownership. However, the
          idealization of free software and open-source has not completely died
          out. Many of the hackers continued to believe that free software will
          be driven by community innovation rather than corporate interests.
          While Bill Gates was moaning about ripoffs, Tom Pittman made an
          interpreter and decided to test out whether would people pay for
          software when it was cheaper. People would send him a mail with a
          donation, saying that 5 dollars is too little or they already have a
          copy from their friend so no need to mail anything to them. Today,
          half of the world's servers are running on Linux and the open-source
          community voluntarily maintains it with no monetary incentives.
          <br /><br />
          The true hacker ethics of willingness to share information freely for
          the ultimately collective good still survives and actively contributes
          to the hacker culture today. I think compromising the ideal for mass
          adoption is important in spreading the hacker ethic. People should be
          granted free access to a computer and information, and benefit from
          the personal computer and devices revolution when accessibility was
          brought from the university labs to our hands.

        <h2>Game Hackers</h2>
        <p>Sunday, September 15, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          The third generation of hackers living in a world that flourishes from
          the foundations built by MIT and hardware hackers. Access to computers
          has become unlimited and total. Video games being the most popular
          software at the time were distributed to millions of people and spiral
          the sale of personal computers. Innovation was fueled by competition,
          monetary incentives, and greed. Is greed a good thing for innovation?
          I think the answer is yes but with balance. Reality is always
          somewhere in between(the compromise of idealism and nature), when
          companies prioritize both creativity and profitability, they can
          create sustainable innovation. But when greed becomes the dominant
          force, it can lead to short-term thinking and stifle creativity with
          individuals or companies focusing on quick profits rather than having
          a long-term vision for innovation( Lootboxes and Game Pass). In
          today's market, we see mass success of tripe A games and also indie
          games. They are a reflection of companies who are motivated by
          incentives and studios with intrinsic motivation, both contribute to
          the balance of the market. <br /><br />
          Steve Levy asks the question “Why shouldn’t Atari be happy with a
          royalty paid by people who wanted to hack Pac-Man code and eventually
          improve the game? Did the public benefit from one company ‘owning’ a
          piece of software and preventing others from making it more useful?”
          Such philosophical suggestion reflect how hacker ethics compromise
          when it meets the market. Hackers would start to consider paying
          royalties in exchange for the ability to use and modify that original
          code, which is not something MIT and hardware hackers would consider.
          It is the ultimate collision between idealism and reality. A couple of
          decades have passed since John Harris made the Jawbreaker and the
          intellectual protection for video games has become more robust.
          However, the philosophical suggestions many hackers believe have come
          to a reality with the rise of open-source software and modding
          communities today. Platforms such as Valve would encourage players to
          purchase mods as part of the sales go the original mods creator,
          Unreal Engine would start taking 5% royalties for games that exceed 2
          million dollars in sales. Maybe the money is not only the incentives,
          money is a reflection of approval for people buying the software
          products. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, and now the power
          has moved from the hacker circle to the public. In some cases, money
          is not one-dimensional but also a reflection of how good the hacking
          is, and it could also act as a motivation for the hackers.
          <br /><br />
          I think hacker ethics can survive in a world of commercial and
          proprietary software, however, it’s difficult to become the mainstream
          voice. I believe the vast majority of the market is filled with
          bureaucracy and greed, a reflection of human nature and constructs. I
          think it’s more likely for hacker ethics to be empowered by
          individuals who are intrinsically motivated, and flourish in small
          organizations but not large corporations. Sierra On-Line grew and
          became more successful and Ken Williams began to prioritize making
          Sierra a more structured and commercial success company. Many
          companies follow this pattern of starting as a creative powerhouse but
          as they grow and scale, to survive, compete, and dominate, they have
          to embrace business practices that support long-term growth and
          profitability. A simple analogy would be, that with more people in a
          friend group, it's hard to decide on where to hang out on Sunday. If
          you want to friend group who's passionate about hiking, keep the
          friends group small and connect with other groups who like hiking.
          <br /><br />
          It’s a big world and there’d always be someone who believes in and
          embodies hacker’s ethics and perfectionism, grabbing the ring without
          being corrupted. Chris Sawyer wrote the entire Roller Coaster Tycoon
          in x86 assembly in a period in which there were high-level programming
          languages to be chosen from. John Harris spends his free time hacking
          games and the reward it’s simply just the satisfaction of doing it.
          Today, many developing tools(popular web-developing frameworks like
          React and Vue, OS like Linux) are being freely distributed and
          maintained by the open-source community, they did it out of love,
          intrinsic motives, and beliefs of hacker ethics. I think the longevity
          of good products would be better off to keep open-source than
          exclusive. It sounds communist but we've seen countless examples of
          how bad greed and power disrupt. When kept open-source, the software
          is constantly being corrected by the masses and reflects the median of
          the mass opinions, rather than being centralized to a selected group
          of people who maybe don't even under the basics.
          <br /><br />
          I don’t believe in one-dimensional and believe that we could always be
          the best of both worlds. In modern-day software development theme, we
          are expected to be professional as there are strict deadlines and
          expectations for working in a software company to develop software.
          Software engineers are expected to develop reliable and ethical (a bit
          ambiguous/idealistic) software products that have much real-world
          impact. Instances such as CrowdStrike and Microsoft outages should be
          strictly avoided due to the power they have on the economy and social
          impact. However, in addition to being professional, I think
          programmers should have a love for computing in their hearts. People
          who don't care will never make great products. As a CS student there
          are multiple instances where I get burned out studying the subject,
          what pulls me back on track has always been self-discipline(what you
          need to go far in anything) and my general love for computing. No
          matter what I’m doing, browsing online, playing games, or learning
          computer concepts, I love sitting in front of my computer and learn
          new things on it. After finishing Lvey’s book, I realized I have been
          practicing some of the hacker’s ethics without knowing and I believe
          that it’s natural for me to try to keep on practicing the hacker
          ethics and perfectionism.

        <h2>Nerds and Hackers</h2>
        <p>Sunday, September 29, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          I found that Paul Graham’s version of a hacker mostly matched Steven
          Levy’s description with a slight emphasis on independence. Paul
          believes that hackers are makers, just like painters and architects,
          they thrive on learning by doing(hands-on imperative). Levy emphasizes
          the revolutionary spirit, communal aspects, and ethical dimension of
          hacking, while Graham focuses on individual creativity and the maker
          mindset. Paul Graham presents a more uncritical, positive portrayal of
          hackers and his perspective is more aligned with current
          entrepreneurial and technological trends. He pointed out that modern
          hackers(software engineers) are merely technicians who translate the
          visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code. Compared
          to video game companies in the 80s who praised their star hackers,
          nowadays for big companies the default plan is to suppress
          creativities. They do it because it decreases the standard deviation
          of the outcome. Only a small percentage of hackers can design
          software, and it's hard for the people running a company to pick these
          out. So instead of entrusting the future of the software to one
          brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed
          by a committee, and the hackers merely implement the design. The
          problem is that when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points
          and the low. Nowadays it’s rarer for large companies to come up with
          innovative software, but there’s still hope in smaller organizations
          and individual programmers. <br /><br />
          Deriving from original MIT hackers, with less emphasis on hacker
          ethics, Paul believes that hackers are craftsmen, who practice design
          through software development and care significantly about the
          execution and details of their creation. Ironically, he also points
          out that “It's odd that people think of programming as precise and
          methodical. Computers are precise and methodical. Hacking is something
          you do with a gleeful laugh.” Paul’s version of a hacker is someone
          who has the traits of playfulness and creativity, as well as the
          technical ability to dedicate his leisure time to writing beautiful
          software. Paul parallel with his own experience of learning and doing,
          pointed out that you should figure out programs as you're writing
          them, just as writers painters, and architects do. Contradicated to
          what we have learned in school which is to figure out the program on
          paper before we even write a single line of code. He called this
          process “ sketching”. He draws similarity to how painters figured out
          the details of painting as they progressed, no one figured out the
          whole painting at first. I see the reasoning behind this approach, as
          much like how people prefer different indentation styles for curly
          brackets, I prefer to sketch on a piece of paper. As much as I love
          working on my computer, there’s something magical about picking up a
          metal pen and scratching your idea on a piece of paper, taking a short
          break for your eyes from the computer screen.
          <br /><br />
          There are some interesting points Paul made to support his argument.
          Painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn
          by doing. If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order,
          you'll find that each painting builds on things that have been learned
          in previous ones. When there's something in a painting that works very
          well, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some
          earlier painting. Paul argues that hackers become great through a
          similar approach, they learn how to write beautiful programs by
          watching other people’s programs and the way to create something
          beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already
          exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. It’s
          obvious that Paul sees hackers as creative and this description
          greatly matches the modern artistic creative scene. Often, new music,
          art, and movies are made from the adoption of something that already
          exists. As I was studying at art school, such an approach is common as
          we describe this process as pulling from inspiration, and often the
          final product is a mush before various inspiration sources. A story I
          want to share is, for a long time when I was studying at art school, I
          struggled with the belief that it’s up to artists to come up with
          something completely original. Later I learned that this is not true
          and everything comes from inspiration and mimicking. There’s no new
          idea under the sun, everything is a reference to things that existed
          prior, and the only thing new is our point of view, how we express it,
          design it, and present it will make the idea new.
          <br /><br />
          To Paul, hackers are similar to painters, someone who use code as a
          medium for creative expression(innovation and unique software), much
          like how painters smudge their paint on canvas. As a student who came
          from fine arts training, I could strongly resonate with this
          connection. My introduction to computer science came from creative
          play which uses code as a tool for creative expression, much like
          painting on a canvas. As far as the readings we have done so far, this
          week’s reading is something I resonate with and learned from the most.
          I get to validate lots of my own beliefs through Paul’s writing. I
          think Paul Graham's version of a hacker is largely compatible with
          Steven Levy's description. His arguments for modern hackers validated
          a lot of my own beliefs and I think I aligned more with his version of
          hackers than the hackers presented by Steve Levy. One thing that stood
          out to me is to create your vision of software, the benefit of working
          in a startup will exceed translating someone else vision in a large
          company. A side note, by Paul’s description of how he’s friends with
          lots of kids from the “freak” group in high school, I laughed out loud
          because I have never thought I matched the description of freaks and
          I’ve always wondered why I’m naturally gravitated towards making
          friends with those who consider as “nerds”. Marginalized group support
          each other I suppose.

        <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
        <p>Sunday, October 6, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          <i style="font-style: italic;">"When you choose technology, you have to ignore what other people are doing and consider only what will work best. Design your product to please the users. If you win the users, everything else will follow. And if you don't, no one will care how comfortingly orthodox your technology choices are. And it follows inexorably that, except in special cases, you ought to use the most powerful you can get."</i>
          <br /><br />
          The programming languages we chose to use shape our approach to conceptualizing and tackling problems, just like how natural languages influence how we express ideas. As a bilingual speaker who speaks Mandarin and English, Chinese is more powerful in terms of grammar and characters, there's many more ways to communicate the same idea in a way that's rich with subtle ambiguities and complex layers of meaning. Was it as precise and straightforward as English? It could be, in a different way. Choosing to speak one over another requires me to think about how to use the words and construct the sentences differently. When I speak to my friends who are also bilingual, we communicate in a mixture of English and Chinese simultaneously. Why?  Each language has its edge when communicating, we use whichever makes sense to the context that comes to mind first. The same applies to programming languages, though can not be mixed up(imagine it could, could that be what Paul proposed to be a better programming language in 100 years?), and each one has its strength. Language like Lisp might encourage programmers to think in terms of recursive solutions, whereas a language like C might push towards a more low-level mindset where memory management is the main concern. English is straightforward and concise, and Chinese is better suited for nuanced expressions that are rich in sentiment and emotions. Both get the job done just like how programming languages are all Turing complete.
          <br /><br />
          What makes one programming language better than another? For me, it's not so much about performance or speed, but about how it influences us to construct an application and how effectively it allows us to write concise, readable, and maintainable(reusable) code, as well as the ability to achieve the same results in less code. The ease of expressing complex ideas can differ drastically, with one language requiring hundreds of lines of code for something that takes just a few lines in another. Paul Graham believes that inefficient software isn't gross, what's gross is a language that makes programmers do needless work. Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency, not wasting machine time. This might be a controversial idea by it’s true as computers get faster, the consideration for machine time could be largely neglected, something only previous hackers could dream of. In the programming languages landscape today, most software is developed and maintained in a handful of selective popular languages. Using nonmainstream language has become rare and somewhat obsolete to the industry standard. But does industry best practice get us the best not merely the average? I think when choosing technology(tools), we need to ignore what other people are doing and consider only what will work best, no matter the programming language or frameworks. We ought to always choose the most powerful tool we can get that applies to our unique situation while having a comprehensive understanding of the tradeoff of the tools that are available to us. 
          <br /><br />
          No doubt the choice of programming language in software development is incredibly important, it affects how a developer approaches a solution, the efficiency of that solution, and the maintainability of the codebase. In the future of programming languages, ideas like functional programming and high-level abstraction tools will continue to be relevant. The language that has the smallest, cleanest cores will persist. As Paul Graham puts it, the more of a language you can write in itself the better.</h3>
