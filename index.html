      <h3>Part 1: True Hackers</h3>
      <h3>“The world opened up by the computer was a limitless one”<br><br>
        What is a true hacker? Steve Levy states that a true hacker is knowledgeable in their technology domain to push boundaries and explore systems, is driven by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving, and is committed to the principles of openness, mistrust authority(promote decentralization), and all information should be free. A true hacker is characterized by the obsessiveness of their craft, determination, curiosity, and openness. 
        <br><br>
        One quality that stands out to me is hackers believe that “essential lessons can be learned about the systems(about the world) from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using that knowledge to create new and more interesting things”. The first thing that comes to mind is why? To satisfy their curiosity? To fix a broken thing or to improve the performance of a system? “Imperfect systems infuriate hackers, whose primal instinct is to debug them.” You can create art and beauty on a computer and hackers are the artists who paint with the brush. In a way, the hacker is an example of inheritance best of both worlds. A perfectionist who envisions the perfect system and an action taker who’s not afraid to act on their vision and dive into the unknown by tearing things apart, improving existing systems, or building a new creation from the ground up. I admire them for being the brave ones in their domain.
        <br><br>
        True hackers share this belief that whatever goal they set their mind to, they will achieve it, one way or another. They have this “blind confidence” in their capability to create something out of limited resources. If a program does not exist, they will bring it to life. Peter Samson had a deep interest in music and computers, and he translated his interests into the creation of a pioneering program that allowed the cranky huge machine to play music, which was unheard of at the time.
        <br><br>
        The standard thinking on computer, their time was so precious that one should only attempt things which took maximum advantage of the computer. However, hackers chose to act on their beliefs: anything that seemed interesting or fun was fodder and encouraged. Of course, such pursuit resulted in pioneering programs such as Music Player and Spacewar. Another quality that I admire about hacker culture is they believe that learning comes from doing, and not merely from the classroom. TMRC hacker Bob Wagner wrote 3000 lines of code for a computer program to perform the function of a calculator and proudly did his Numerical Analysis homework on it. He received an 0 for achieving the same goal with significantly more complicated methods but he couldn’t care less. Arguably, when he went out of his way to integrate his passion into problem-solving required significantly more learning while achieving the same goal.
        <br><br>
        A notion that has initially struck me is how hackers believe that information should be free. Steve "Slug" Russell and his peers who created and improved the original Spacewar game decided to freely distribute the software of video games to others as they are open and welcoming for anybody to make changes and improve the games. They weren’t thinking of profit but the contribution to the open-source community. For some reason, I keep thinking about how Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak made Blue boxes that allowed people to make free, illegal, long-distance phone calls and they decided to sell for profit. Even though they were not in the same time period, could it mean hackers share a common ethics but still act on their own beliefs?
        <br><br>
        I found the idea of a true hacker inspirational. My previous impression of a hacker is someone who uses their knowledge of technology to illegally break into a digital system to take advantage of the breach, mostly for financial gain or access to information. Levy’s writing challenged my notion of a hacker and allowed a comprehensive view of their characteristics and ethics from the original hackers. I started to understand their motives and drives come from curiosity and implementing improvement to the system. In many ways, I believe I subscribe the the hacker’s beliefs, values, and way of thinking. The hacker culture is “hermit-like”, which is true to some extent. They avoid people that’s not their kind but have no problem socializing with fellow hackers. It functions like the star in the space war game that pulls like-minded people in with gravitational force, with their love for hacking, sci-fi references, bad movies, and Chinese food. As much as I share similar passions and interests, I do not see myself living the lifestyle of a true hacker as I believe that there’s more to life. I believe in taking what’s good and abandoning what’s bad. For example, I subscribe to obsessiveness over one’s craft and improvement in the system, but I also value balance and a somewhat healthy lifestyle which prevent me from staying up all night for a 30-hour hacking session. However, something I’ve always believed in is that we could be the best of both worlds.

      <h3>People would pay for a hammer to do its job, not for it to exist.
        <br><br>
        True hackers value technical ability and raw creativity that proves oneself that’s worthy to their inclusive community of hacking into software. Anyone who can’t or who doesn’t dedicate all of their time to hacking is considered a “loser". Hardware hackers were activated during the Vietnam War and the hippie and counter-culture movements. They believe that bringing computers to the masses would create a better and more liberated society and technology would empower people and the world. The computer was a tool that large institutions had sequestered. Opening it up and making it available to everyone was the ultimate act of liberation.
        <br><br>
        Upon reading the second part of the book, I’m mostly intrigued by why the notion of free software couldn't continue outside the MIT lab. Certainly, we have to bring up two of the biggest tech companies in the world that were born during the hardware hackers era. With the popularity and the floating copies of Altair Basic, Bill Gates published "An Open Letter to Hobbyists" and called out that software would only be better when people received incentives for their hard work. At Apple, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs had different opinions on the approach to personal computers, especially regarding whether they should be free and accessible to everyone or commercialized. Something worth noticing is that at MIT labs software was freely distributed among students, even placed in a drawer right next to the computer. The Homebrew Computer Club follows the rule that if you take one copy of the software, you should bring back two copies. Times have changed when computers reached the hands of hardware hackers, this is the era when the ideal was compromised into reality when business and profitability were taken into personal computers. As much as I subscribe to the true hackers’ ethics, I must admit that hackers themselves exist in a niche market. The idealization of 100% freely distributed software will work in a niche environment like MIT hackers when the student group devotes their entire life to hacking when the club of true hackers itself is exclusive. Once the technology is brought to the masses by hardware hackers, there will inevitably be friction during adoption. Human nature is complex and dynamic. I think Bill Gates is only the first person to decide to profit from the software. If it wasn’t him, it would be someone else. Just like how Amazon survived to be the biggest commerce website in the US, if not for Jeff Bezos, someone would have decided and succeeded in profiting from the online shipping theme of the internet age. 
        Proprietary software has shaped today's industry standards, with companies like Microsoft and Apple embodying the entrepreneurial spirit of early hardware innovators
        <br><br>
        Why can't we have free software? I would say the reason behind it is rooted in human nature around value and ownership. However, the idealization of free software and open-source has not completely died out. Many of the hackers continued to believe that free software will be driven by community innovation rather than corporate interests. While Bill Gates was moaning about ripoffs, Tom Pittman made an interpreter and decided to test out whether would people pay for software when it was cheaper. People would send him a mail with a donation, saying that 5 dollars is too little or they already have a copy from their friend so no need to mail anything to them. Today, half of the world's servers are running on Linux and the open-source community voluntarily maintains it with no monetary incentives.
        <br><br>
        The true hacker ethics of willingness to share information freely for the ultimately collective good still survives and actively contributes to the hacker culture today. I think compromising the ideal for mass adoption is important in spreading the hacker ethic. People should be granted free access to a computer and information, and benefit from the personal computer and devices revolution when accessibility was brought from the university labs to our hands.
