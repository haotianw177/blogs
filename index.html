        <h2>True Hackers</h2>
        <p>Friday, August 30, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          “The world opened up by the computer was a limitless one”<br /><br />
          What is a true hacker? Steve Levy states that a true hacker is
          knowledgeable in their technology domain to push boundaries and
          explore systems, is driven by curiosity and a passion for
          problem-solving, and is committed to the principles of openness,
          mistrust authority(promote decentralization), and all information
          should be free. A true hacker is characterized by the obsessiveness of
          their craft, determination, curiosity, and openness.
          <br /><br />
          One quality that stands out to me is hackers believe that “essential
          lessons can be learned about the systems(about the world) from taking
          things apart, seeing how they work, and using that knowledge to create
          new and more interesting things”. The first thing that comes to mind
          is why? To satisfy their curiosity? To fix a broken thing or to
          improve the performance of a system? “Imperfect systems infuriate
          hackers, whose primal instinct is to debug them.” You can create art
          and beauty on a computer and hackers are the artists who paint with
          the brush. In a way, the hacker is an example of inheritance best of
          both worlds. A perfectionist who envisions the perfect system and an
          action taker who’s not afraid to act on their vision and dive into the
          unknown by tearing things apart, improving existing systems, or
          building a new creation from the ground up. I admire them for being
          the brave ones in their domain.
          <br /><br />
          True hackers share this belief that whatever goal they set their mind
          to, they will achieve it, one way or another. They have this “blind
          confidence” in their capability to create something out of limited
          resources. If a program does not exist, they will bring it to life.
          Peter Samson had a deep interest in music and computers, and he
          translated his interests into the creation of a pioneering program
          that allowed the cranky huge machine to play music, which was unheard
          of at the time.
          <br /><br />
          The standard thinking on computer, their time was so precious that one
          should only attempt things which took maximum advantage of the
          computer. However, hackers chose to act on their beliefs: anything
          that seemed interesting or fun was fodder and encouraged. Of course,
          such pursuit resulted in pioneering programs such as Music Player and
          Spacewar. Another quality that I admire about hacker culture is they
          believe that learning comes from doing, and not merely from the
          classroom. TMRC hacker Bob Wagner wrote 3000 lines of code for a
          computer program to perform the function of a calculator and proudly
          did his Numerical Analysis homework on it. He received an 0 for
          achieving the same goal with significantly more complicated methods
          but he couldn’t care less. Arguably, when he went out of his way to
          integrate his passion into problem-solving required significantly more
          learning while achieving the same goal.
          <br /><br />
          A notion that has initially struck me is how hackers believe that
          information should be free. Steve "Slug" Russell and his peers who
          created and improved the original Spacewar game decided to freely
          distribute the software of video games to others as they are open and
          welcoming for anybody to make changes and improve the games. They
          weren’t thinking of profit but the contribution to the open-source
          community. For some reason, I keep thinking about how Steve Jobs and
          Steve Wozniak made Blue boxes that allowed people to make free,
          illegal, long-distance phone calls and they decided to sell for
          profit. Even though they were not in the same time period, could it
          mean hackers share a common ethics but still act on their own beliefs?
          <br /><br />
          I found the idea of a true hacker inspirational. My previous
          impression of a hacker is someone who uses their knowledge of
          technology to illegally break into a digital system to take advantage
          of the breach, mostly for financial gain or access to information.
          Levy’s writing challenged my notion of a hacker and allowed a
          comprehensive view of their characteristics and ethics from the
          original hackers. I started to understand their motives and drives
          come from curiosity and implementing improvement to the system. In
          many ways, I believe I subscribe the the hacker’s beliefs, values, and
          way of thinking. The hacker culture is “hermit-like”, which is true to
          some extent. They avoid people that’s not their kind but have no
          problem socializing with fellow hackers. It functions like the star in
          the space war game that pulls like-minded people in with gravitational
          force, with their love for hacking, sci-fi references, bad movies, and
          Chinese food. As much as I share similar passions and interests, I do
          not see myself living the lifestyle of a true hacker as I believe that
          there’s more to life. I believe in taking what’s good and abandoning
          what’s bad. For example, I subscribe to obsessiveness over one’s craft
          and improvement in the system, but I also value balance and a somewhat
          healthy lifestyle which prevent me from staying up all night for a
          30-hour hacking session. However, something I’ve always believed in is
          that we could be the best of both worlds.

        <h2>Hardware Hackers</h2>
        <p>Sunday, September 08, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          People would pay for a hammer to do its job, not for it to exist.
          <br /><br />
          True hackers value technical ability and raw creativity that proves
          oneself that’s worthy to their inclusive community of hacking into
          software. Anyone who can’t or who doesn’t dedicate all of their time
          to hacking is considered a “loser". Hardware hackers were activated
          during the Vietnam War and the hippie and counter-culture movements.
          They believe that bringing computers to the masses would create a
          better and more liberated society and technology would empower people
          and the world. The computer was a tool that large institutions had
          sequestered. Opening it up and making it available to everyone was the
          ultimate act of liberation.
          <br /><br />
          Upon reading the second part of the book, I’m mostly intrigued by why
          the notion of free software couldn't continue outside the MIT lab.
          Certainly, we have to bring up two of the biggest tech companies in
          the world that were born during the hardware hackers era. With the
          popularity and the floating copies of Altair Basic, Bill Gates
          published "An Open Letter to Hobbyists" and called out that software
          would only be better when people received incentives for their hard
          work. At Apple, Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs had different opinions on
          the approach to personal computers, especially regarding whether they
          should be free and accessible to everyone or commercialized. Something
          worth noticing is that at MIT labs software was freely distributed
          among students, even placed in a drawer right next to the computer.
          The Homebrew Computer Club follows the rule that if you take one copy
          of the software, you should bring back two copies. Times have changed
          when computers reached the hands of hardware hackers, this is the era
          when the ideal was compromised into reality when business and
          profitability were taken into personal computers. As much as I
          subscribe to the true hackers’ ethics, I must admit that hackers
          themselves exist in a niche market. The idealization of 100% freely
          distributed software will work in a niche environment like MIT hackers
          when the student group devotes their entire life to hacking when the
          club of true hackers itself is exclusive. Once the technology is
          brought to the masses by hardware hackers, there will inevitably be
          friction during adoption. Human nature is complex and dynamic. I think
          Bill Gates is only the first person to decide to profit from the
          software. If it wasn’t him, it would be someone else. Just like how
          Amazon survived to be the biggest commerce website in the US, if not
          for Jeff Bezos, someone would have decided and succeeded in profiting
          from the online shipping theme of the internet age. Proprietary
          software has shaped today's industry standards, with companies like
          Microsoft and Apple embodying the entrepreneurial spirit of early
          hardware innovators
          <br /><br />
          Why can't we have free software? I would say the reason behind it is
          rooted in human nature around value and ownership. However, the
          idealization of free software and open-source has not completely died
          out. Many of the hackers continued to believe that free software will
          be driven by community innovation rather than corporate interests.
          While Bill Gates was moaning about ripoffs, Tom Pittman made an
          interpreter and decided to test out whether would people pay for
          software when it was cheaper. People would send him a mail with a
          donation, saying that 5 dollars is too little or they already have a
          copy from their friend so no need to mail anything to them. Today,
          half of the world's servers are running on Linux and the open-source
          community voluntarily maintains it with no monetary incentives.
          <br /><br />
          The true hacker ethics of willingness to share information freely for
          the ultimately collective good still survives and actively contributes
          to the hacker culture today. I think compromising the ideal for mass
          adoption is important in spreading the hacker ethic. People should be
          granted free access to a computer and information, and benefit from
          the personal computer and devices revolution when accessibility was
          brought from the university labs to our hands.

        <h2>Game Hackers</h2>
        <p>Sunday, September 15, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          The third generation of hackers living in a world that flourishes from
          the foundations built by MIT and hardware hackers. Access to computers
          has become unlimited and total. Video games being the most popular
          software at the time were distributed to millions of people and spiral
          the sale of personal computers. Innovation was fueled by competition,
          monetary incentives, and greed. Is greed a good thing for innovation?
          I think the answer is yes but with balance. Reality is always
          somewhere in between(the compromise of idealism and nature), when
          companies prioritize both creativity and profitability, they can
          create sustainable innovation. But when greed becomes the dominant
          force, it can lead to short-term thinking and stifle creativity with
          individuals or companies focusing on quick profits rather than having
          a long-term vision for innovation( Lootboxes and Game Pass). In
          today's market, we see mass success of tripe A games and also indie
          games. They are a reflection of companies who are motivated by
          incentives and studios with intrinsic motivation, both contribute to
          the balance of the market. <br /><br />
          Steve Levy asks the question “Why shouldn’t Atari be happy with a
          royalty paid by people who wanted to hack Pac-Man code and eventually
          improve the game? Did the public benefit from one company ‘owning’ a
          piece of software and preventing others from making it more useful?”
          Such philosophical suggestion reflect how hacker ethics compromise
          when it meets the market. Hackers would start to consider paying
          royalties in exchange for the ability to use and modify that original
          code, which is not something MIT and hardware hackers would consider.
          It is the ultimate collision between idealism and reality. A couple of
          decades have passed since John Harris made the Jawbreaker and the
          intellectual protection for video games has become more robust.
          However, the philosophical suggestions many hackers believe have come
          to a reality with the rise of open-source software and modding
          communities today. Platforms such as Valve would encourage players to
          purchase mods as part of the sales go the original mods creator,
          Unreal Engine would start taking 5% royalties for games that exceed 2
          million dollars in sales. Maybe the money is not only the incentives,
          money is a reflection of approval for people buying the software
          products. Hackers should be judged by their hacking, and now the power
          has moved from the hacker circle to the public. In some cases, money
          is not one-dimensional but also a reflection of how good the hacking
          is, and it could also act as a motivation for the hackers.
          <br /><br />
          I think hacker ethics can survive in a world of commercial and
          proprietary software, however, it’s difficult to become the mainstream
          voice. I believe the vast majority of the market is filled with
          bureaucracy and greed, a reflection of human nature and constructs. I
          think it’s more likely for hacker ethics to be empowered by
          individuals who are intrinsically motivated, and flourish in small
          organizations but not large corporations. Sierra On-Line grew and
          became more successful and Ken Williams began to prioritize making
          Sierra a more structured and commercial success company. Many
          companies follow this pattern of starting as a creative powerhouse but
          as they grow and scale, to survive, compete, and dominate, they have
          to embrace business practices that support long-term growth and
          profitability. A simple analogy would be, that with more people in a
          friend group, it's hard to decide on where to hang out on Sunday. If
          you want to friend group who's passionate about hiking, keep the
          friends group small and connect with other groups who like hiking.
          <br /><br />
          It’s a big world and there’d always be someone who believes in and
          embodies hacker’s ethics and perfectionism, grabbing the ring without
          being corrupted. Chris Sawyer wrote the entire Roller Coaster Tycoon
          in x86 assembly in a period in which there were high-level programming
          languages to be chosen from. John Harris spends his free time hacking
          games and the reward it’s simply just the satisfaction of doing it.
          Today, many developing tools(popular web-developing frameworks like
          React and Vue, OS like Linux) are being freely distributed and
          maintained by the open-source community, they did it out of love,
          intrinsic motives, and beliefs of hacker ethics. I think the longevity
          of good products would be better off to keep open-source than
          exclusive. It sounds communist but we've seen countless examples of
          how bad greed and power disrupt. When kept open-source, the software
          is constantly being corrected by the masses and reflects the median of
          the mass opinions, rather than being centralized to a selected group
          of people who maybe don't even under the basics.
          <br /><br />
          I don’t believe in one-dimensional and believe that we could always be
          the best of both worlds. In modern-day software development theme, we
          are expected to be professional as there are strict deadlines and
          expectations for working in a software company to develop software.
          Software engineers are expected to develop reliable and ethical (a bit
          ambiguous/idealistic) software products that have much real-world
          impact. Instances such as CrowdStrike and Microsoft outages should be
          strictly avoided due to the power they have on the economy and social
          impact. However, in addition to being professional, I think
          programmers should have a love for computing in their hearts. People
          who don't care will never make great products. As a CS student there
          are multiple instances where I get burned out studying the subject,
          what pulls me back on track has always been self-discipline(what you
          need to go far in anything) and my general love for computing. No
          matter what I’m doing, browsing online, playing games, or learning
          computer concepts, I love sitting in front of my computer and learn
          new things on it. After finishing Lvey’s book, I realized I have been
          practicing some of the hacker’s ethics without knowing and I believe
          that it’s natural for me to try to keep on practicing the hacker
          ethics and perfectionism.

        <h2>Nerds and Hackers</h2>
        <p>Sunday, September 29, 2024</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          I found that Paul Graham’s version of a hacker mostly matched Steven
          Levy’s description with a slight emphasis on independence. Paul
          believes that hackers are makers, just like painters and architects,
          they thrive on learning by doing(hands-on imperative). Levy emphasizes
          the revolutionary spirit, communal aspects, and ethical dimension of
          hacking, while Graham focuses on individual creativity and the maker
          mindset. Paul Graham presents a more uncritical, positive portrayal of
          hackers and his perspective is more aligned with current
          entrepreneurial and technological trends. He pointed out that modern
          hackers(software engineers) are merely technicians who translate the
          visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code. Compared
          to video game companies in the 80s who praised their star hackers,
          nowadays for big companies the default plan is to suppress
          creativities. They do it because it decreases the standard deviation
          of the outcome. Only a small percentage of hackers can design
          software, and it's hard for the people running a company to pick these
          out. So instead of entrusting the future of the software to one
          brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed
          by a committee, and the hackers merely implement the design. The
          problem is that when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points
          and the low. Nowadays it’s rarer for large companies to come up with
          innovative software, but there’s still hope in smaller organizations
          and individual programmers. <br /><br />
          Deriving from original MIT hackers, with less emphasis on hacker
          ethics, Paul believes that hackers are craftsmen, who practice design
          through software development and care significantly about the
          execution and details of their creation. Ironically, he also points
          out that “It's odd that people think of programming as precise and
          methodical. Computers are precise and methodical. Hacking is something
          you do with a gleeful laugh.” Paul’s version of a hacker is someone
          who has the traits of playfulness and creativity, as well as the
          technical ability to dedicate his leisure time to writing beautiful
          software. Paul parallel with his own experience of learning and doing,
          pointed out that you should figure out programs as you're writing
          them, just as writers painters, and architects do. Contradicated to
          what we have learned in school which is to figure out the program on
          paper before we even write a single line of code. He called this
          process “ sketching”. He draws similarity to how painters figured out
          the details of painting as they progressed, no one figured out the
          whole painting at first. I see the reasoning behind this approach, as
          much like how people prefer different indentation styles for curly
          brackets, I prefer to sketch on a piece of paper. As much as I love
          working on my computer, there’s something magical about picking up a
          metal pen and scratching your idea on a piece of paper, taking a short
          break for your eyes from the computer screen.
          <br /><br />
          There are some interesting points Paul made to support his argument.
          Painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn
          by doing. If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order,
          you'll find that each painting builds on things that have been learned
          in previous ones. When there's something in a painting that works very
          well, you can usually find version 1 of it in a smaller form in some
          earlier painting. Paul argues that hackers become great through a
          similar approach, they learn how to write beautiful programs by
          watching other people’s programs and the way to create something
          beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already
          exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. It’s
          obvious that Paul sees hackers as creative and this description
          greatly matches the modern artistic creative scene. Often, new music,
          art, and movies are made from the adoption of something that already
          exists. As I was studying at art school, such an approach is common as
          we describe this process as pulling from inspiration, and often the
          final product is a mush before various inspiration sources. A story I
          want to share is, for a long time when I was studying at art school, I
          struggled with the belief that it’s up to artists to come up with
          something completely original. Later I learned that this is not true
          and everything comes from inspiration and mimicking. There’s no new
          idea under the sun, everything is a reference to things that existed
          prior, and the only thing new is our point of view, how we express it,
          design it, and present it will make the idea new.
          <br /><br />
          To Paul, hackers are similar to painters, someone who use code as a
          medium for creative expression(innovation and unique software), much
          like how painters smudge their paint on canvas. As a student who came
          from fine arts training, I could strongly resonate with this
          connection. My introduction to computer science came from creative
          play which uses code as a tool for creative expression, much like
          painting on a canvas. As far as the readings we have done so far, this
          week’s reading is something I resonate with and learned from the most.
          I get to validate lots of my own beliefs through Paul’s writing. I
          think Paul Graham's version of a hacker is largely compatible with
          Steven Levy's description. His arguments for modern hackers validated
          a lot of my own beliefs and I think I aligned more with his version of
          hackers than the hackers presented by Steve Levy. One thing that stood
          out to me is to create your vision of software, the benefit of working
          in a startup will exceed translating someone else vision in a large
          company. A side note, by Paul’s description of how he’s friends with
          lots of kids from the “freak” group in high school, I laughed out loud
          because I have never thought I matched the description of freaks and
          I’ve always wondered why I’m naturally gravitated towards making
          friends with those who consider as “nerds”. Marginalized group support
          each other I suppose.

          >
          <br /><br />
          The programming languages we chose to use shape our approach to
          conceptualizing and tackling problems, just like how natural languages
          influence how we express ideas. As a bilingual speaker who speaks
          Mandarin and English, Chinese is more powerful in terms of grammar and
          characters, there's many more ways to communicate the same idea in a
          way that's rich with subtle ambiguities and complex layers of meaning.
          Was it as precise and straightforward as English? It could be, in a
          different way. Choosing to speak one over another requires me to think
          about how to use the words and construct the sentences differently.
          When I speak to my friends who are also bilingual, we communicate in a
          mixture of English and Chinese simultaneously. Why? Each language has
          its edge when communicating, we use whichever makes sense to the
          context that comes to mind first. The same applies to programming
          languages, though can not be mixed up(imagine it could, could that be
          what Paul proposed to be a better programming language in 100 years?),
          and each one has its strength. Language like Lisp might encourage
          programmers to think in terms of recursive solutions, whereas a
          language like C might push towards a more low-level mindset where
          memory management is the main concern. English is straightforward and
          concise, and Chinese is better suited for nuanced expressions that are
          rich in sentiment and emotions. Both get the job done just like how
          programming languages are all Turing complete.
          <br /><br />
          What makes one programming language better than another? For me, it's
          not so much about performance or speed, but about how it influences us
          to construct an application and how effectively it allows us to write
          concise, readable, and maintainable(reusable) code, as well as the
          ability to achieve the same results in less code. The ease of
          expressing complex ideas can differ drastically, with one language
          requiring hundreds of lines of code for something that takes just a
          few lines in another. Paul Graham believes that inefficient software
          isn't gross, what's gross is a language that makes programmers do
          needless work. Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency, not
          wasting machine time. This might be a controversial idea by it’s true
          as computers get faster, the consideration for machine time could be
          largely neglected, something only previous hackers could dream of. In
          the programming languages landscape today, most software is developed
          and maintained in a handful of selective popular languages. Using
          nonmainstream language has become rare and somewhat obsolete to the
          industry standard. But does industry best practice get us the best not
          merely the average? I think when choosing technology(tools), we need
          to ignore what other people are doing and consider only what will work
          best, no matter the programming language or frameworks. We ought to
          always choose the most powerful tool we can get that applies to our
          unique situation while having a comprehensive understanding of the
          tradeoff of the tools that are available to us.
          <br /><br />
          No doubt the choice of programming language in software development is
          incredibly important, it affects how a developer approaches a
          solution, the efficiency of that solution, and the maintainability of
          the codebase. In the future of programming languages, ideas like
          functional programming and high-level abstraction tools will continue
          to be relevant. The language that has the smallest, cleanest cores
          will persist. As Paul Graham puts it, the more of a language you can
          write in itself the better.

          I've always intrigue by the idea of work hard and retire early. Not
          meaning retire early to lay in a chair, but to have time and enegery
          to work on thing's that means something to me and the greater good.
          Creating a company is surely exciting and one of the more reliable
          ways to generate wealth, but more than 90% of the startup failed. The
          historical data shouldn’t be overlooked. Looking back on history, I
          found that to increase the survival rate of a startup, it’s crucial to
          leverage the tailwind. Tailwind is usually built by the macro
          environment, specific technology advances (AI wave, dot com),
          government policy, and the economic booming of a environment(1960s
          America, 1990s China). Leverage those macro environment as well as
          build a small, measurable team that contribute directly to the source
          is more likely to contribute to success. Paul Graham also mentioned
          that the common mistakes in startup is not winning enough users,
          building something that users want, and finding the product market
          fit. The problem is sometimes refer to as premature optimization,
          which is optimization without protytpe or users. Until you have some
          users to measure, you're optimizing based on guesses and people could
          not care about your creation as much as you do. If if brings no value
          that solve a unique problem, no one will use it.
          <br /><br />
          Is technological progress and possible improvement in living
          conditions worth a widening incoming gap? When humans shifted from
          tribal hunter-gatherer societies to farming, our quality of life
          arguably worsened due to harder labor, reduced dietary diversity, and
          increased disease. However, this transition allowed for faster
          population growth and the development of larger, more complex
          civilizations, despite the personal hardships it introduced. I see the
          resemblance in technological progress here, where advancements, while
          improving certain aspects of our lives, often come with trade-offs.
          Thanks to technological advancement, we're able to pivot and transform
          further into a complex civilization as a whole, is it worth
          sacrificing individual benefits(wage gap and possibly worsening living
          conditions for some)? To me, yes, because it matters we progress
          further as a whole species.
          <br /><br />
          I think the next big technological platforms will be the web and some
          type of wearable. Time has proven that the web can bring technology to
          the masses in a short period of time. You can not beat something that
          has mass accessibility and relatively low cost. I could also envision
          that a wearable technology breakthrough would possibly happen in the
          next decade or two. VR and AR technology in mixed reality could be the
          bridges to complete the virtual reality technology someday. It does
          seem like big techs such as Meta and Apple are trying to push in that
          direction and with technology advancement, what was once imagined or
          pushed towards seems to always come to reality.
          <br /><br />
          I wasn’t surprised by the success of Paul Graham, time has proven that
          we’ve always rewarded those who create value for us. What intrigued me
          is the idea that Paul talked about, having a small number on the team
          so you can measure productivity and leverage the power to create
          value. The encouragement of risk taking won’t slow down, the peddle
          has become even faster. By leveraging technology today, even a
          non-technical person can create something that requires technical
          skills. The next big thing in our society is generative AI and some
          wearable, or maybe a wearable powered with AI.
          <br /><br />
          For me, I'm always eyeing for the storm. The storm of changing in
          macro environment, order of the hierarchy, as well as technology
          advancement. Such storm will disrupt the order of things, which is the
          perfect time to dive in to the eye of the storm and make something for
          yourself and the world. We see countless example of startup riding the
          waves of storm and disrupt the old industry monopoly. In Paul Graham's
          vision, create wealth. Storms comes in waves and usually take decades
          to form, where it lies opportunity also lies danger, but no rewards
          will be granted for those who won't be willing to take risk.

        <h2>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</h2>
        <p>Sunday, November 3, 2024.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          <i style="font-style: italic">Free for All</i>
          <br /><br />
          I’ve heard many stories about how Linux is a top-of-the-line example
          of a successful open-source project and am always curious how it rose
          to such status. What perplexes me is the concept that a large group of
          people are willing to work together, and dedicate their time to create
          something beautiful, robust, and free. Perhaps it shouldn't come as a
          surprise since the video games MOD community has been thriving for a
          while. It’s obvious that the U.S. runs in a capitalist environment and
          everything comes with a price, especially an expert programmer’s free
          time. Such a concept of open source projects seems rather “hippy” or
          “communist”. Where do we generate profit? Perhaps most capitalists
          would ask. As I progressed reading, it became clear to me how a
          “bazaar” software development model has its strengths and makes sense.
          Perhaps the most reasonable explanation would be we willingly do
          something out of love and satisfaction, and how the process creates
          value for like-minded people and the community.
          <br /><br />
          The lesson ESR talks about provided great insight into the principles
          of a great programmer and why an open-source programming community is
          superior and often yields higher-quality programs than a close source.
          ESR talks about how treating users as co-developers is the least
          hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging. Such
          an approach requires a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base,
          and almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix
          obvious to someone. Assuming the user is largely experienced
          developers would feel comfortable making contributions. Compared to
          proprietary software which relies on a selected few programmers to
          build a reliable and stable product, ESR talks about Linux’s early and
          Frequent releases rather than building out a good prototype with fewer
          mistakes, release early, and release often. “More users find more bugs
          because adding more users adds more different ways of stressing the
          program.” Similar to many open-source games such as Dota and Doom, the
          source code is open for the players to create MOD. Thus, ensuring the
          longevity and rapid development of the project, given a large enough
          community.
          <br /><br />
          In the software landscape today, the majority of software follows the
          cathedral approach, which greatly ties to how a company is structured.
          The needs of order, structure, and small groups of contributors that
          hold all the power. Cathedral approach is rather a reflection of the
          capitalist society and for-profit software and companies. Open source
          project seems rather a utopian and ideal version of hacker ethics
          which hackers dedicate a great amount of resources to keep
          alive(leisure time, their passion). To me, open source projects
          represent the rebellious ambition of hackers, it’s their voice and
          vision of how an idealistic world should be. Remember how the Homebrew
          Computer Club members passionately advocated for personal computing as
          a way to decentralize technology, to democratize computing from the
          dominant force in which large corporations and government institutions
          had exclusive control over powerful, centralized computing systems?
          <br /><br />
          Which model is superior? Can they mutually exclusively exist? I think
          diversity is always a healthy sign for a macro environment. Greater
          diversity usually means greater possibilities that something could
          evolve, which also prevents stagnation and obsolete. Currently,
          proprietary software significantly overweight open-source projects. To
          ensure a prosperous future of the software macro environment that
          stays innovative, new open-source projects should be encouraged or
          rewarded. Most importantly, I think the idea of open-source software
          and the reason for its importance should be spread out more among the
          developer community.

          >
          <br /><br />
          As ESR discusses in his essay, one of the majority reasons that many
          developers are intrinsically motivated by the joy and satisfaction of
          practicing their craftsmanship in creating beautiful software. Open
          source allows them to work on projects that interest them without
          corporate constraints. ESR talks about how reputation is the only
          valuable measurement in open source and writing quality code and
          contributing to impactful projects is a means of earning social
          status. Many open-source contributors are also drawn by the philosophy
          of freedom that values transparency, collaboration, and accessibility,
          which counters proprietary software’s restrictions.
          <br /><br />
          ESR talks about the taboos, the first being the strong social pressure
          against forking projects. Open source projects thrive when there’s a
          unified community working towards shared goals, There’s also a
          cultural expectation to respect the core group of
          maintainers/contributors’ vision and decisions. Similarly,
          distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the
          moderators is frowned upon. Lastly, removing a person's name from a
          project history, credit, or maintainer list is not done without the
          person's explicit consent. From reading the essay, the open source
          community seems to have a strong cultural bond/values that all
          contributors agreed upon and such agreements are what strengthens a
          community.
          <br /><br />
          The most interesting point ESR raised is the concept of gift culture.
          ESR argues that the gift culture only exists in resource abundance
          areas and once the fundamental survival needs are met. In the gift
          economy, reputation(being a reliable/respectable contributor) seems to
          be the only thing that matters as the appeal lies not only in ego
          satisfaction but also in the deeper sense of community impact,
          self-improvement, and shared purpose. I found the gift economy
          appealing, growing up I directly benefited from the gift and open
          source culture, as I have pirated games and software from time to
          time. I still run a PS2 emulator to play PS2 games like Silent Hill
          and Tony Hawk thanks to the open-source community keeping the emulator
          project alive. As I started to contribute to the open source
          community, I thought that ego satisfaction through reputation is more
          secondary than the general love for the crafts and the community
          involved around it. To me, the joy or fulfillment comes from the fact
          of knowing that my contribution makes someone else life a bit easier
          and more enjoyable, the intrinsic joy of practicing craftsmanship on
          the projects that I love, as well as the contribution to the
          community’s involvement and longevity. I believe in contributing to
          the common good as well as playing as the gear to keep the cycle
          running for future generations.
          <br /><br />
          Joy, curiosity, community, and love are what entice people to
          contribute to open source. As a newbie, I would argue that some
          barriers prevent me from getting involved. To list a few, imposter
          syndrome, fear of public criticism, and lack of certain skills.
          However, you'd never improve if you step forward. I would imagine my
          contribution will start small and simple and involve a project that
          I'm naturally drawn to. To sustain a healthy community, it is
          important to be respectful, follow community guidance as well as
          follow the inclusive social agreements in the community.
          <br /><br />
          I want to make a side note about something we discussed in last
          Tuesday's session. Someone in the class mentioned that if you're not
          involved in a project/community, you can never understand or imagine
          their problem/struggles. I think that's a great point for starting a
          business in the future or when thinking about joining/contributing to
          a community.

          I think that the choice between collecting rent and enabling independent peer review depends heavily on the context. Proprietary software often suits well for businesses seeking immediate financial return from intellectual property, especially in industries where control over secret algorithms (AI models, encryption, trading algo) provides a competitive advantage. This model can stifle innovation but also sparks competition.Open-source software that allow independent peer review projects like Linux and Apache thrive because they access and harness the collective intelligence of global developer community each with their own specciality. It works well for infrastructure software that require reliability, security, and compatibility. Yet, open-source struggles when companies exploit its codebase without contributing back, which is a tension that’s increasingly evidently today. 
          <br /><br />
          Open source is not broken, but it is evolving.  Open source still makes business sense, but its sustainability depends on adapting to modern challenges. In a cloud dominated pipeline, open source is indispensable because most popular infrastructure like Kubernetes, Linux, and Apacheis open-source. However, the economics are becoming  increasingly challenging especially when major cloud providers (AWS, Azure) use open-source projects to build profitable services without directly contributing back.
          To address the challenges in the future, one of the approach could be non profitable partnership with established organization. Partnerships with cloud providers, and other proprietary projects that rely heavily on a functional open source software community. The sustainability of open source requires balancing its ideals of openness and collaboration with practical mechanisms for funding and governance.In an ideal situation, open source project can seek through funding from it’s direct benefited source. Companies such as B Corporation often carries the value of contributing to social good as well as sustainability. Such companies could be a good resource of funding if they directly benefit from existing open source project.
          <br /><br />
          Many open-source projects rely on the unpaid labor of a few maintainers, creating burnout and financial strain, and encouraging financial support will only help and not limit the development of open source projects . I think that open source project’s lower barriers to entry, and the nature foster collaboration will continue to thrive. While the traditional vision of open source, which is driven purely by passion, love and community collaboration still exists, the realities of funding, sustainability, and commercialization have led to necessary adjustments. Much like the adaption of hacker culture, the magic cauldron will continues to thrive, but on order to ensure its longevity requires thoughful balancing of community ideals and efforts with practical a more economic models.

          I found Linus Torvalds upbringing story inspiring as it mostly align with the development of a traditional hacker profile. Linus talked about how his first love comes from meddling the old calculus calculator and watching the cranky machine actually take time to perform the calculation rather than looks up solutions in the dictionary.  Eventually, he get his hands on one of the first computer that allowed his to program in BASIC.  He would read the manual of the computer and write example programs and eg his grandfather for English computer books. He described he has to decode the language into Finnish since he wasn’t fluent in English. He talked about how as the computer get more complex, it’s harder for beginner to disassemble them and put them back together. His story and profile match with the MIT hackers, an introverted, socially awkward kids who’s good at hard science, have natural curiosity of how things works, and the hands on imperative  to break things apart and put them back together. His grandfather served as the mentor his childhood development, as he provided the tools(calculator, computer) to satisfy Linus’s curiosity and the education to guide him through the development of Linus’s curiosity(the time they spend together input data in to computer, computer books etc). Linus describe the time of him meddling with computer was the best feeling ever.  One intersting thing is Linus consider computer as a “toy”, and the time other boys would read palyboy magazine, he would spend that time playing with his favorite toy.
          <br /><br />
          Looking back to my life, I wouldn’t say my upbringing are similar to Linus, even though situation happened and turned me into a kid who’s more introverted and intersted in computer. Perhaps the wrong dimension of the computer, I was more intersted in video games and online forums than how computer works. Linus talked about how modern computer got kids hook on video games and make them stupid, I definitely felt that. Have I was more geeky kid who’s natural curious of tearing things apart, or good at one or two hard science, my life would turn out very different right now. But I guess you’re product of the environment and everything you did lead you to the current steps. When I was six years old, I have been chose as one of the two kids, out of the total of 50 kids in my class to have early education in computer science and programming. I remember after the very first session I came back home to my mom and told her I wasn’t intersted in the subject, and she supported my decision. Many years later and many trail and erroes, I decide to pursue computer scinece education. Sometimes I do wonder if I was push towards that chance of taking the computer scinece education at the first grade, how much my life would be different right now. Maybe I wouldn’t ended up at Notre Dame? Maybe I wouldn’t come to the State at all? Will I be a genius hacker that is fluent in programming assembly? I’d probably have the same taste in bad clothing and coke cola.
          <br /><br />
          Comparing Linus journey to those of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg, Gates and Zuckerberg built their success on leveraging business opportunities within technological revolutions, while Steve Jobs focused on design and user experience. Linus, however, represents the pure hacker, creating for the sake of solving problems and sharing knowledge. All of them were position at the right time of the historical waves, when software and technology innovation are at the position of creation of the mass wealth and mass corporation. Linus stand alone as the only one who decide to distribute his creation for free rather than gaining generational wealth. His story is deeply inspiring, it shows the impact can emerge from a place of curiosity and collaboration rather than a focus on commercial success. 
          <br /><br />
          Personal computer evolution, software evolution, internet evolution, cryptocurrency, and now AI, technology innovation break through come in waves. Usually takes a decade or two to form. The best odds of succeed will be the creation of a project that align with the innovation wave. Personally, I’m more drawn to Steve Jobs and Linus’s story of success. I’m drawn to creating beautiful design and user experience that will translate to a technology products and services. On top of my interests, I have always believe that information should be freely distributed, as I learned and benefit from this belief as well. When I was studying graphic design and web development, I had witness many beautiful design and projects that benefited from open source human collaboration, such experience definitely reassured my interests in open source projects. As I move forward in life, I’m not shy away from the business world and hopefully I’d find a balance of creating beautiful software products and open source projects. Even though I did not have similar backstory of many hackers, I do long to be remember for the creation of something that contribute positively to the humanity.
