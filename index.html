      <h3>Part 1: True Hackers</h3>
      <h3>“The world opened up by the computer was a limitless one”<br><br>
        What is a true hacker? Steve Levy states that a true hacker is knowledgeable in their technology domain to push boundaries and explore systems, is driven by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving, and is committed to the principles of openness, mistrust authority(promote decentralization), and all information should be free. A true hacker is characterized by the obsessiveness of their craft, determination, curiosity, and openness. 
        <br><br>
        One quality that stands out to me is hackers believe that “essential lessons can be learned about the systems(about the world) from taking things apart, seeing how they work, and using that knowledge to create new and more interesting things”. The first thing that comes to mind is why? To satisfy their curiosity? To fix a broken thing or to improve the performance of a system? “Imperfect systems infuriate hackers, whose primal instinct is to debug them.” You can create art and beauty on a computer and hackers are the artists who paint with the brush. In a way, the hacker is an example of inheritance best of both worlds. A perfectionist who envisions the perfect system and an action taker who’s not afraid to act on their vision and dive into the unknown by tearing things apart, improving existing systems, or building a new creation from the ground up. I admire them for being the brave ones in their domain.
        <br><br>
        True hackers share this belief that whatever goal they set their mind to, they will achieve it, one way or another. They have this “blind confidence” in their capability to create something out of limited resources. If a program does not exist, they will bring it to life. Peter Samson had a deep interest in music and computers, and he translated his interests into the creation of a pioneering program that allowed the cranky huge machine to play music, which was unheard of at the time.
        <br><br>
        The standard thinking on computer, their time was so precious that one should only attempt things which took maximum advantage of the computer. However, hackers chose to act on their beliefs: anything that seemed interesting or fun was fodder and encouraged. Of course, such pursuit resulted in pioneering programs such as Music Player and Spacewar. Another quality that I admire about hacker culture is they believe that learning comes from doing, and not merely from the classroom. TMRC hacker Bob Wagner wrote 3000 lines of code for a computer program to perform the function of a calculator and proudly did his Numerical Analysis homework on it. He received an 0 for achieving the same goal with significantly more complicated methods but he couldn’t care less. Arguably, when he went out of his way to integrate his passion into problem-solving required significantly more learning while achieving the same goal.
        <br><br>
        A notion that has initially struck me is how hackers believe that information should be free. Steve "Slug" Russell and his peers who created and improved the original Spacewar game decided to freely distribute the software of video games to others as they are open and welcoming for anybody to make changes and improve the games. They weren’t thinking of profit but the contribution to the open-source community. 
        <br><br>
        I found the idea of a true hacker inspirational. My previous impression of a hacker is someone who uses their knowledge of technology to illegally break into a digital system to take advantage of the breach, mostly for financial gain or access to information. Levy’s writing challenged my notion of a hacker and allowed a comprehensive view of their characteristics and ethics from the original hackers. I started to understand their motives and drives come from curiosity and implementing improvement to the system In many ways, I believe I subscribe the the hacker’s beliefs, values, and way of thinking. The hacker culture is “hermit-like”, which is true to some extent. They avoid people that’s not their kind but have no problem socializing with fellow hackers. It functions like the star in the space war game that pulls like-minded people in with gravitational force, with their love for hacking, sci-fi references, bad movies, and Chinese food. As much as I share similar passions and interests, I do not see myself living the lifestyle of a true hacker as I believe that there’s more to life. I believe in taking what’s good and abandoning what’s bad. For example, I subscribe to obsessiveness over one’s craft and improvement in the system, but I also value balance and a somewhat healthy lifestyle which prevent me from staying up all night for a 30-hour hacking session. However, something I’ve always believed in is that we could be the best of both worlds.
